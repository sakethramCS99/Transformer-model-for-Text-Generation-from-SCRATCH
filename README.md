# Transformer Model for Text Generation from Scratch ðŸš€

## Overview
This repository implements a **Transformer model for text generation from scratch**, built entirely using **PyTorch**. Inspired by the groundbreaking architecture introduced in the paper *"Attention is All You Need"*, this project provides a hands-on exploration of Transformers, the backbone of modern NLP advancements like GPT, BERT, and T5.

Whether you're a beginner eager to learn about Transformers or an experienced developer seeking to understand their inner workings, this repository is your go-to resource.

- **Configurable Hyperparameters**:
  - Easily adjust key settings such as **number of layers**, **embedding dimensions**, **attention heads**, **context length**, and more.

- **Text Tokenization**:
  - Tokenizes input text for training and generation using efficient tokenization libraries.

- **Training Pipeline**:
  - Train on custom datasets with a simple, configurable training loop.
  - Optimized for GPU and CPU training.

- **Text Generation**:
  - Autoregressively generates text sequences based on an input prompt.

## How It Works

### Architecture
The Transformer model consists of **decoder-only architecture** (like GPT):
- **Attention Mechanism**:
  - Implements **scaled dot-product attention** for capturing dependencies in text sequences.
  - **Multi-head attention** allows the model to focus on multiple aspects of the input simultaneously.
- **Feedforward Network**:
  - Applies fully connected layers with **non-linear activation** (ReLU) to learn complex relationships.
- **Positional Encoding**:
  - Encodes the position of tokens in a sequence to maintain order information, since Transformers are position-agnostic.
- **Layer Normalization and Dropout**:
  - Used for regularization and stabilizing training.

### Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Tokenizes input text from the dataset and splits it into fixed-length sequences for training.
2. **Training**:
   - The model predicts the next token in a sequence using a **causal language modeling objective**.
   - Loss is computed using **CrossEntropyLoss**.
3. **Text Generation**:
   - Given a starting sequence (prompt), the model generates text iteratively by predicting one token at a time.
