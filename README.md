# Transformer-model-for-Text-Generation-from-SCRATCH
**Transformer Model for Text Generation ðŸš€**

**Description:**

  This repository implements a Transformer-based model for text generation from scratch, built entirely in PyTorch. The model is designed to process text data, learn complex patterns, and generate coherent text sequences based on input prompts.
  
  Whether you're a student, researcher, or developer interested in understanding Transformers at a deeper level, this project serves as a hands-on resource to explore the inner workings of one of the most powerful architectures in natural language processing (NLP).

**Features:**
      
    *From Scratch Implementation*: Every key component, including multi-head attention, position encoding, and feedforward networks, is implemented manually to showcase the architecture.
    *Custom Training Loop*: Includes a custom pipeline for training the model on your dataset.
    *Text Tokenization*: Uses the tiktoken library for efficient tokenization.
    *Configurable Hyperparameters*: Easily adjust model dimensions, number of attention heads, context length, and more.
    *Scalable*: Supports training on both GPU and CPU.


**How It Works**
    **Architecture:**
    
    Follows the standard Transformer architecture with multiple attention layers.
    Implements scaled dot-product attention and position encoding.
    
    **Training Process:**
    
    A dataset (e.g., textbook.txt) is tokenized and divided into sequences of fixed context length.
    The model is trained using CrossEntropyLoss to predict the next token in a sequence.
    
    **Text Generation:**
    
    Once trained, the model generates text sequences based on input prompts using autoregressive decoding.
